  /**
   * Initiates a request to asynchronously generate a backtest for an authorization
   * rule. During backtesting, both the active version (if one exists) and the draft
   * version of the Authorization Rule are evaluated by replaying historical
   * transaction data against the rule's conditions. This process allows customers to
   * simulate and understand the effects of proposed rule changes before deployment.
   * The generated backtest report provides detailed results showing whether the
   * draft version of the Auth Rule would have approved or declined historical
   * transactions which were processed during the backtest period. These reports help
   * evaluate how changes to rule configurations might affect overall transaction
   * approval rates.
   *
   * The generated backtest report will be delivered asynchronously through a webhook
   * with `event_type` = `auth_rules.backtest_report.created`. See the docs on
   * setting up [webhook subscriptions](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/events-api). It
   * is also possible to request backtest reports on-demand through the
   * `/v2/auth_rules/{auth_rule_token}/backtests/{auth_rule_backtest_token}`
   * endpoint.
   *
   * Lithic currently supports backtesting for `CONDITIONAL_BLOCK` rules. Backtesting
   * for `VELOCITY_LIMIT` rules is generally not supported. In specific cases (i.e.
   * where Lithic has pre-calculated the requested velocity metrics for historical
   * transactions), a backtest may be feasible. However, such cases are uncommon and
   * customers should not anticipate support for velocity backtests under most
   * configurations. If a historical transaction does not feature the required inputs
   * to evaluate the rule, then it will not be included in the final backtest report.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const backtest = await client.authRules.v2.backtests.create(
   *   '182bd5e5-6e1a-4fe4-a799-aa6d9a6ab26e',
   * );
   * ```

  }

  /**
   * Returns the backtest results of an authorization rule (if available).
   *
   * Backtesting is an asynchronous process that requires time to complete. If a
   * customer retrieves the backtest results using this endpoint before the report is
   * fully generated, the response will return null for `results.current_version` and
   * `results.draft_version`. Customers are advised to wait for the backtest creation
   * process to complete (as indicated by the webhook event
   * auth_rules.backtest_report.created) before retrieving results from this
   * endpoint.
   *
   * Backtesting is an asynchronous process, while the backtest is being processed,
   * results will not be available which will cause `results.current_version` and
   * `results.draft_version` objects to contain `null`. The entries in `results` will
   * also always represent the configuration of the rule at the time requests are
   * made to this endpoint. For example, the results for `current_version` in the
   * served backtest report will be consistent with which version of the rule is
   * currently activated in the Auth Stream, regardless of which version of the rule
   * was active in the Auth Stream at the time a backtest is requested.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const backtestResults =
   *   await client.authRules.v2.backtests.retrieve(
   *     '182bd5e5-6e1a-4fe4-a799-aa6d9a6ab26e',
   *     '182bd5e5-6e1a-4fe4-a799-aa6d9a6ab26e',
   *   );
